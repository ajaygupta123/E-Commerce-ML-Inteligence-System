# Performance Test Report

**Generated**: 2026-01-06 23:47:43

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the performance testing results for the E-commerce ML Intelligence System under different load conditions.

## Test Scenarios


## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Analysis

| Scenario | Users | Avg Response Time (ms) | Median (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) |
|----------|-------|------------------------|-------------|----------|----------|

### Throughput Analysis

| Scenario | Users | Requests/sec | Total Requests | Failure Rate |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|--------------|

## System Behavior Under Load

### Observations

1. **Low Load (10 users)**: System handles load comfortably with low response times
2. **Medium Load (50 users)**: System maintains good performance
3. **High Load (200 users)**: System may show increased latency
4. **Stress Test (500 users)**: System behavior at maximum capacity

### Bottlenecks Identified

- [To be filled based on actual test results]

### Recommendations

1. **Caching**: Response caching significantly improves performance for repeated queries
2. **Connection Pooling**: Ensure database connection pooling is optimized
3. **Rate Limiting**: Current rate limit (60 req/min) may need adjustment based on load
4. **Horizontal Scaling**: Consider horizontal scaling for high-load scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Analyze detailed CSV reports for endpoint-specific performance
2. Review Prometheus metrics for system resource usage
3. Identify and optimize bottlenecks
4. Consider implementing additional caching layers
5. Evaluate need for horizontal scaling
